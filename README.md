# Student Performance Prediction using ANFIS and ANN

This project runs a UI that gives a prediction of the student grade either by using ANN(Artificial Neural Network) or ANFIS(Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) by taking in the user input.

## Getting Started

The code was written using Python3 for UI and ANN and Matlab for ANFIS.

### Prerequisites

Following are the packages you will need:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. TensorFlow
4. Matlab engine
5. Tkinter
6. Neuro Fuzzy tool box in Matlab

### Installation
For the matlab engine - follow the steps in this link
